## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[There were no outside resources used to complete my submission.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[While completing this submission, the only challenge I encounterd was severe procrastination. Procrastination has always
has always been a major obstacle for me. However, while completing this submission I tried to past myself by doing
working on the submission little-by-little. As oppose to saving everything for the last day and doing it all at once.
Evern this was difficult for me, because I even though I broke the task down into smaller tasks, that made it easier
for me to procrastinate, due to the fact that the task that needed to be completed was small. However, through perserverance
this allowed me to fight off my procrastination and complete my submission.]


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I really enjoyed creating this game. The only question I have is what resources can be recommended to me, so that I can learn more.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would I add features like a graphic background, different sounds the buttons can make, and random patters.]
